## About Me
The "About" page is a brief summary of myself.  It includes a link to my personal LinkedIn page as well as a photo of myself.  The "About" page is accessible from all other pages through using the Navbar.

## Portfolio
The "Portfolio" page will eventually display images of the work I have created.  For now, while I build up my portfolio, the images are placeholders.  The "Portfolio" page is accessible from all other pages through using the Navbar.

## Contact
On the "Contact" page, site users can input their Name, Email, and a message in order to get in touch with me.  The "Contact" page is accessible from all other pages through using the Navbar.
